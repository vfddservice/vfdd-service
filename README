== Installation notes

To install and run vfdd (vFabric Data Director) service gateway, you must have 
the Cloud Foundry vcap and vcap-services code properly deployed. The tested 
versions are:
cloudfoundry/vcap           commit: e6378a1d7987557cb9316e73124db37e1a3268c8
cloudfoundry/vcap-services  commit: 867720a10b4b89b6258d1e8476fb36043a4639cf

1. Install Cloud Foundry
Follow the installation guide of the Cloud Foundry:
https://github.com/cloudfoundry/vcap
bash < <(curl -s -k -B https://raw.github.com/cloudfoundry/vcap/master/dev_setup/bin/vcap_dev_setup)

2. Get a copy of vFDD service gateway code and copy (or link) it to the Cloud
Foundry services directory.
For example,
ln -s ${PATH_TO_VFDD_SERVICE_PACKAGE}/vcap-services/vfdd \
${PATH_OF_CLOUDFOUNDRY_INSTALLATION}/cloudfoundry/vcap/services/vfdd

When you follow the guide in step 1, the PATH_OF_CLOUDFOUNDRY_INSTALLATION
is default to your home path of the installation user.

3. Install packages required by vfdd service gateway
cd ${PATH_OF_CLOUDFOUNDRY_INSTALLATION}/cloudfoundry/vcap/services/vfdd
bundle install --deployment
If bundle is not available in the PATH variable, you can find it at the following 
path (the ruby version may change):
${PATH_OF_CLOUDFOUNDRY_INSTALLATION}/cloudfoundry/.deployments/devbox/deploy/ \
rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p180/bin/

4. Add vfdd as a new built-in service
Edit the cloud_controller configuration file, which is located by default at
${PATH_OF_CLOUDFOUNDRY_INSTALLATION}/cloudfoundry/.deployments/devbox/ \
config/cloud_controller.yml,
add vfdd service in 'builtin_services:' section and configure your own secret
token, as the following,
 vfdd:
    token: changeme

5. Configure vfdd service gateway
The configuration file is located at,
${PATH_OF_CLOUDFOUNDRY_INSTALLATION}/vcap-services/vfdd/config/vfdd_gateway.yml,
you can edit it directly or make a copy. Read the comments in this file to make
the configurations. At the same time, you need to create the parent directory 
for the local database (which is default to /var/vcap/services/vfdd/).
Note: special care should be taken for the mbus section, which should be configured
correctly, you can follow the configurations of other components, for example,
${PATH_OF_CLOUDFOUNDRY_INSTALLATION}/cloudfoundry/.deployments/devbox/ \
config/mysql_gateway.yml

6. [optional] This step is only needed is you want to start/stop vfdd service 
gateway with 
${PATH_OF_CLOUDFOUNDRY_INSTALLATION}/cloudfoundry/vcap/dev_setup/bin/vcap_dev
command.
1) Modify the following component configuration file to add "vfdd_gateway" at 
the end of the list:
${PATH_OF_CLOUDFOUNDRY_INSTALLATION}/cloudfoundry/.deployments/devbox/ \
config/vcap_components.json

2) Copy of link your vfdd service gateway configuration file to the default path,
for example,
ln -s ${PATH_OF_CLOUDFOUNDRY_INSTALLATION}/vcap-services/vfdd/config/vfdd_gateway.yml \
${PATH_OF_CLOUDFOUNDRY_INSTALLATION}/cloudfoundry/.deployments/devbox/config/vfdd_gateway.yml

3) Create an executable script named ${PATH_OF_CLOUDFOUNDRY_INSTALLATION}/ \
cloudfoundry/vcap/bin/services/vfdd_gateway with contents:
  #!/usr/bin/env ruby
  exec(File.expand_path("../../../services/vfdd/bin/vfdd_gateway", __FILE__), *ARGV)

== Internals of the service gateway

To reduce the response time when the Cloud Foundry user request a vFDD 
database, the provisioning of databases is based on a pooling mechanism. The 
current pool policy is using fixed pool size (However, it's straight-forward to 
add more intelligent policy which is sensitive to the current load). When the size 
of the pool is under the target size, a background task will be started to 
provision new databases (Currently, there is only one thread for this task at
the same time). Similarly, the deletion of a database from vmc command is also 
asynchronous. And a dedicated worker is used for the clean-up. There can also 
be some cases which can cause the provisioning or deleting task fail, and 
service gateway will mark the task as failed when a maximum retries are reached.
To maintain the current databases which are created in the pool or being 
provisioned/deleting or failed, a local sqlite database is used.

To inspect the content of the database, the following command can be used:  
bash$ sqlite3 /var/vcap/services/vfdd/vfdd_gateway.db (or other path configured)
sqlite> select * from vcap_services_vfdd_provisioner_database_sets;
creating
pooled
deleting
failed
sqlite> select * from vcap_services_vfdd_provisioner_databases;
....
